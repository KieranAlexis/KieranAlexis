- 👋 Hi, I’m @KieranAlexis

- 👀 I’m interested in ... wide range of dev & CS topics - I came to computing via an interest in crypto and electronic music engineering, 

- 🌱 I’m currently  ... about to start a PHP course from Stephan Mishook, the last in his full stack web dev package - HTML | CSS | JavaScript 
Big into Cardano, so looking to develop with that, and became interested in Haskell. I like CS in general, so I tend to follow abstract learning
as well as trying to actually make stuff. Have spent the last few months wading about in WordPress and I'm ready to move on before I stuck there forever :/ 
I read the Bitcoin OpTech list and run a BTC node. Did a load of certificated courses with Ivan On Tech, including Bitcoin Script. I decided not to learn 
Solidity or support Ethereum in general, as I feel Cardano eclipses all that soon.
Other projects I have been interested in long term - Zilliqa, Celsius, Blockstack

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, not sure yet. 
I got involved with Blockstack in 2019/2020 and did my first coding with a thing they did called 'Zero To Dapp' [I got a T-Shirt!].
It was because of that course that I opened a GitHub account in fact. 
I shifted to tracking Cardano when the Stacks 2.0 whitepaper came out as it was a bit of a change of direction for Blockstack. 
Am tracking various projects - Podverse in particular, which has led me to sort out how to use github once and for all. Hence this readme. 
Idea atm is to use the podverse project to finally get more involved and push things into the next stage for me as a dev, starting with
orienting myself on here. I follow Adam Curry, so that's where I heard about Podcasting 2.0
